								<h2>Personal Statement</h2>

							<p>
								My values and aspirations have been shaped by the experiences that I’ve had. Completing
                                a summer internship in my junior year of high school was one such perspective-altering
                                event. Before that summer, I saw my education as just involving classes and grades. My
                                internship made me realize that my education should include learning experiences outside
                                the classroom. Since this time, my primary academic goal has been to learn and challenge
                                myself outside of my classes. In high school, I achieved this by competing in the
                                Greater New Orleans Science and Engineering Fair. By enlisting the help of a professor
                                from Tulane University, I was able to learn about heat transfer and gain insight into
                                the process of research in college. Now at Texas A&M, I’ve joined the Autonomous
                                Underwater Vehicle project team. As a member, I will learn CAD using Solidworks and I
                                will learn fabrication techniques such as machining. I’ve chosen these different
                                projects to give me a variety of experiences. I’ve also chosen them because they are
                                congruent to my major: mechanical engineering.
							</p>

								My family influenced my decision on field of study. Visiting my uncle’s work is the
                                reason I chose mechanical engineering as my major. During this visit, my uncle showed
                                me an intricate 3d model of an oil rig crane on his computer. Then, he brought me
                                outside to see the same crane, towering above me, in person. This experience stuck with
                                me. I realized that I wanted to be an engineer to design things like him. Meanwhile, my
                                parents, both computer scientists, exposed me to programming. I began trying to design
                                computer games at a young age with a children’s coding program called Scratch. This
                                later helped me land my internship where I learned the programming language Python. My
                                mentor during this internship was a computer engineer and he inspired me to minor in
                                computer science.
							</p>

								To chase after these dreams, I set my ambitions on going to Texas A&M. I achieved this
                                by becoming a National Merit Finalist, which allowed me to afford the school. I was able
                                to receive this title only because of my parents’ emphasis on my education. Because my
                                parents sent me to good schools and pushed me to do well, I was able to become a good
                                student. I remember in elementary school my dad would go over my homework with me each
                                night and quiz me in preparation for tests. He forced me to put care into my homework
                                and study until I was mature enough to make those decisions on my own. This set me up
                                for success. My family’s influence has shaped my life in both the decisions I make and
                                the goals I pursue.
