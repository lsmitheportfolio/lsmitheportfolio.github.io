								<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								My parents gave me the values I hold today and have made me the person I am. They never
								forced me to stick with a hobby; they didn’t control who I was friends with; and they
								didn’t force their political or religious beliefs on me. As a result, the friends I made,
								my interests, and my beliefs are all a strong part of me. Furthermore, I’ve made it to
								where I am today because of my parents’ emphasis on my education. I couldn’t have
								achieved what I have without my parents sending me to good schools and pushing me to do
								well. I remember in elementary school my dad would go over my homework with me each night
								and quiz me in preparation for tests. He forced me to put care into my homework and study
								until I was mature enough to make those decisions on my own. This set me up for success
								later in life.
							</p>
							<p>
								My grandparents have also impacted my life by influencing some major decisions. They were
								the first to encourage me to become an engineer. When I was young, and my grandparents
								asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, they would remark how happy my uncle would
								be if I became an engineer like him. Once I got over my desire to be a lawyer, I decided
								to do engineering. My grandparents also encouraged me to come to Texas A&M. They were the
								first to put this school on my radar, and they continued to push for it while I was going
								through the college decision process. I can safely say I wouldn’t be here without them.
							</p>
							<p>
								I wouldn’t be here without my academic achievement either. Becoming a National Merit
								scholar is what allowed me to afford this school. Reaching this goal was a major
								accomplishment, and I can trace my success back to 5 years ago. In 8th grade, I became
								very involved the National Junior Honors Society, a community service club at my school.
								I began devoting a lot of time to service projects and this helped me get more involved
								in my school. Getting involved, and working alongside other high-achieving students,
								helped me become more serious about my grades. This was the year I began striving for all
								A’s. Although I did not achieve this right away, setting this goal had a positive
								influence on my high school career.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of school, I enjoy various hobbies, but none as important as playing board games.
								When I was young, my family would often go to my grandparents’ house on the weekends for
								lunch. It was routine to play a board game during these visits. When I got older, I
								started going to the local game shop with my dad for board game Thursdays. Board games
								began to take over an even larger part of my time in 8th grade when my friend came on a
								family vacation with me. After playing board games with my family all weekend, my friend
								and I began playing board games on our own. Soon, playing board games became the main
								pastime of my friend group. No Friday night was complete without King of Tokyo or The
								Great Dalmuti. Board games are my favorite pastime.
