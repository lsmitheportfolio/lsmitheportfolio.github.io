				<p style="margin-top:50px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music, writing photography, sculpture, 
				recordings, and structural works are protected by copyright. In 
				fact, as soon as one of these is created, it is copyrighted. 
				This allows the creator to sell, recreate, and display the work. 
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everything is copyrighted though. The public domain is a 
				term used to describe all materials that aren’t copyrighted. 
				These works can be freely distributed and used for any (legal) 
				purposes. National materials and materials published before 1923 
				are automatically in it. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long period of time, works 
				become part of the public domain. If anything was published from 
				1923 to 1978, then its copyright expires in 95 years. After 1978, 
				copyrighted materials will expire 95 years over the 
				creator’s lifespan. If a material is copyrighted my multiple 
				people, its copyright lasts for 95 years, but only if it was published. If 
				it wasn’t, then it lasts for 120 years.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creators can always 
				choose to release their works from their copyright early. 
				Copyright can partially protect materials if the creator 
				chooses. A copyright license can do this. It gives the creator 
				control over what parts of the copyright laws he/she wants and 
				what parts can be left out. An open license describes a set of 
				these preferences where the holder’s work can be freely 
				distributed, granted he/she is credited.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Use is the 
				practice of using copyrighted materials. Copyrighted works can 
				be annotated, reviewed, and used to provide knowledge, so long 
				as the user doesn’t violate the copyright-holder’s rights.</p>
