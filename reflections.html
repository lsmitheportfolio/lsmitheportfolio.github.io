				Critical Thinking- ASSESS: Able to make meaning of personal and social responsibility, 
				and respond to needs based upon an understanding of situational context, and interpret data 
				with an awareness of personal biases that may impact outcomes. <br><br>

				How to improve: In engineering, I am only just now learning to identify needs. I have room 
				for improvement, but senior design is helping me learn this skill. Once I have a better understanding 
				of this topic, I will be able to set a goal for myself. For now, I am unsure what “mastery” means to me.  <br><br>

				Communication: Effectively exchanges ideas and perspectives with individuals inside and outside 
				organizations, and communicates in a clear and organized manner so that others can effectively understand. <br><br>

				How to improve: My writing is decent but I have room for improvement. I would like to be able to 
				express my thoughts more clearly and quickly. The more I am forced to write in college, the more I 
				improve in this area. I will feel that I have mastered this competency once I can write essays and 
				emails both clearly and quickly.

			&emsp; &emsp; As a world economic leader, the US has a booming manufacturing sector. Between 1870
and 2014, manufacturing increased twentyfold, going up an average of 8% each year (Egilmez et
al. 860). Nearly a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are caused by manufacturing, so as the
amount of manufacturing increases, so do emissions (Egilmez et al. 854). These are a problem
since they contribute to global warming and severely impact the ecosystem. As Earth’s
population increases and demand for goods goes up, manufacturing is not likely to decrease.
Therefore, it is necessary for manufacturers to examine their carbon footprint and take steps to
reduce it. Currently, scientists are developing ways of doing this by optimizing manufacturing
processes (Edgar and Davis). In addition, more and more businesses are examining
environmental impact when developing new products (Miranda et al. 13065). Despite these
improvements, manufacturing sectors with some of the highest emissions, such as petroleum
refinement, livestock processing, and alloy production, need to take further steps (Egilmez et al.
853). To reduce emissions in these sectors, scientists are developing new technologies and
methods for manufacturing. Engineers are tackling the problem of greenhouse gas emissions
through both general and targeted solutions. <br><br>

				I’m proficient in information literacy and I hope to develop written communication.<br><br>

				Information literacy is useful in a number of situations. When writing research papers,
				knowing how to find good resources is important. This skill helps me find enough information
				even for long papers and it ensures that I present accurate information. This eases the difficulty
				of writing research papers and improves their quality. Information literacy also helps me with
				programming. Troubleshooting a program can be tedious, and finding the solution online is not
				straightforward. I use information literacy to narrow down my problem, find the source if it, and
				then find the solution. Also, if I get lost in a class, this skill can allow me find online resources
				that can help. When I do undergraduate research or internships, this skill can help me learn more
				on my topic of study. Information literacy will help me in my college career.<br><br>

				My written communication skills can be improved with practice. Taking a writing class is
				an important step in improving. I should also try to improve from all writing assignments, not
				just ones from an English class. Visiting the writing center will help with this. By taking each
				writing assignment as a learning experience, I can develop this skill.<br><br>

				In my future career, written communication and information literacy will be important.
				Employers want employees to problem solve, and the internet is an important resource for this.
				Information literacy will help me navigate the internet to find my answers. Written
				communication is important in many aspects. It’s necessary for getting hired, working a group,
				and explaining work to others. Both skills are important in the workplace.
