				&emsp; &emsp; Dell has liquid-cooled server racks which it currently sells to customers. 
To streamline the shipping process, Dell would like to drain 10% of the coolant from each server rack before 
shipping. When the server racks arrive at their destination, their coolant must be topped off. Dell has tasked 
a Texas A&M senior design team with designing a method to do this. <br>
				

&emsp; &emsp; Dell needs a closed system device that can store, drain, and fill coolant 
in a safe and controlled manner. It must integrate the solution in its shipping process without adding significant 
costs. Therefore, this device must be easy to use, to minimize the labor costs of training technicians and 
operating the device. <br>
				

&emsp; &emsp; The device adds value by improving Dell’s shipping process. The new process 
will reduce the total amount of liquids being transported, reducing weight and minimizing the possibility of 
leakage. Dell’s current methods for removing coolant are not cost-effective. <br>

				&emsp; &emsp; My capstone is my mechanical engineering senior design project. I have been 
				tasked by Dell to design a coolant draining and filling solution for its servers. Dell needs 
				to remove coolant from its servers before shipping, as the coolant can freeze during shipping 
				and break components. It then needs to top off coolant once the servers arrive at their destination.<br>

 

				&emsp; &emsp; This is my chance to tackle an actual problem from a company. As a design problem, there are many possible 
				solutions that could meet Dell’s needs. It will be a challenge to narrow down the possibilities and 
				find a suitable solution. It will also be a challenge to define what these needs are and what constitutes 
				a suitable solution. I look forward to developing these skills. Since I am interested in engineering design 
				and want a career in that field, this project fits my interests. It will help me develop my design skills, 
				better preparing me for my first job. This connects to my ability to plan. As I create my project, I want 
				to understand, improve, and achieve: understand the current problem, improve upon current solutions, and 
				achieve a solution that meets my needs.

				&emsp; &emsp; Mechanical Engineering senior projects are projects provided by a sponsor company. In my 
				section, I was given four projects to choose from, which were from Dell, Pumps and Pipes, Baker Risk, 
				and Shell. I chose to do the project on filling and draining coolant from Dell, because it sounded the 
				most interesting. After choosing my project, I was put into a 6-person design team. While we sometimes 
				delegate tasks, we typically discuss and complete tasks as a team. Through meetings, we collaborate to 
				make design decisions.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; In the lecture portion of my senior project class, we are taught different approaches for each step of 
				the engineering design process. This includes different methods for defining needs, generating requirements, 
				brainstorming solutions, and concept selection. I am thrilled to learn strategies for creative design, since 
				this is what I want to do with my career. I am growing by improving my skills in this area. So far, I have 
				learned how to decompose a problem, generate a solution-neutral problem statement, define needs, generate 
				requirements, brainstorm solutions, and select a concept.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Currently, I am in the brainstorming and concept selection phase. I am a little disappointed that I can’t 
				design something truly innovative, but unfortunately, this does not fit with the requirements that I defined 
				with my team. The design will end up being modular, since the final product needs to be easily reproducible.

				&emsp; &emsp; My capstone is my Mechanical Engineering senior design project. This project has an accompanying 
				lecture, where I learn about different parts of the design process. This information has been integral in 
				completing my project. However, this is not the only learning I use. Recently, I had to perform some 
				calculations using knowledge I gained in fluid mechanics. Furthermore, many of my design choices are driven 
				by manufacturability. I learned how important this is to consider last semester, when I designed a metal scissor 
				lift that was challenging to build. This was a painful learning experience that has driven many design choices in 
				my current capstone.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; I want to pursue a career in mechanical design, so this project is teaching me steps of the design 
				process that I will hopefully use in my future career.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; As the power of CPU’s and GPU’s increases, water cooling is becoming increasingly inadequate to 
				cool these devices. Water cooling has the ability to remove much more heat, which is why dell includes liquid 
				cooling infrastructure on its server racks. My project will help Dell ship these racks more safely, paving the way 
				for more liquid cooled computers.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Working with a customer has been a valuable learning experience. Before this project, I never realized 
				the complexities of defining a design problem. It took several meetings for my team and I to understand what Dell was 
				truly looking for, and what they envisioned as a solution. This process has transformed my thinking towards how design 
				problems are defined.

				&emsp; &emsp; At the end of last semester, my senior project team presented our design to our sponsors. We got a lot 
of feedback that forced us to change our design and return the parts we had ordered. While frustrating, our newest design is much better that 
the one we had previously. We are now in the process of ordering new parts and beginning to assemble them.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Now that the system is redesigned, things are starting to come together. Our new design meets our customer 
needs and is resistant to misuse/ damage. We are on track to finish before the semester ends.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; On top of being a team player and working on weekly tasks, I've taken on a few responsibilities. Last 
semester, I was responsible for ensuring that the embodiment design was completed. This semester, I am in charge of redesigning the tubing 
system and selecting parts for this system. Both semesters, I was the chief proofreader for our design reports.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; My goal is to get a career in new product development, and this project has given me tangible experience 
that I can reference in job interviews.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; If given the opportunity to start over, I would have requested to interview the end users of our device 
before starting the design process. I did not get their input until the end of the first semester, after we had designed our device. Their 
feedback was critical to our redesign, but I could have saved time by interviewing them sooner. In addition, if I started over, I would spend 
more time learning about plumbing systems before trying to order tubing and connectors.

          <p>
				&emsp; &emsp; As my project progresses, I have been able to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. I'm feeling 
more confident in my design choices, now that I have learned form past failures.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; When I finally began to assemble the tubing system, and all of the connectors worked, I felt accomplished. 
This was after 2 previous attempts where I found that the connectors I ordered didn't work. This accomplishment is what I enjoyed most about my project.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Despite all I have learned, my repeated failures are making this project tight on time. I'm concerned that 
we may experience more setbacks, which will make it difficult to finish our project before graduation.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; As an aspiring design engineer, this project is my first introduction to a long-term engineering design 
project. I have the freedom to make my own design choices, and if I make mistakes, I have time to correct them. However, because I have a lot 
of time, my final product is expected to be successful. If I could change one thing about my process, I would have tested the parts as soon as 
they arrived, rather than wait for the majority of them to come in. Then, I could have caught my mistakes sooner and ordered new parts immediately.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; I have become very aware of the intricacies of hydraulics systems. Issues arise when connectors are sized 
incorrectly or when they are chosen for the wrong application.

          <p>
				&emsp; &emsp; What first appeared as a simple pump design became much more complicated. When we first designed our 
pumping system, we failed to consider how our device may be misused and how our materials could contaminate our liquid. Our design evolved 
as we considered longevity, user error, and reliability.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; This experience taught me a lot about the engineering design process. I am trying to enter a career 
field where I can use these skills.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; To celebrate, I am going out to lunch with my senior design team and our sponsors.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; My next pursuit is finding a job.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; I would tell my year-ago self to prototype sooner so you can fail faster. Many of the parts I ordered 
did not work as expected, and I could have caught these mistakes and ordered new parts faster if I had begun assembling sooner.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; A schedule will help you get things done. I would suggest planning weekly goals.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Hopefully, Dell will use our design for years to come.

				&emsp; &emsp; This experience has helped me hone my knowledge, skills, and abilities while in college. Experience 
is truly the best teacher, and participating in this hands-on project has taught me a lot about the engineering design process. Now, I feel 
more confident in my ability to abstract a problem, design a solution, and fabricate it. Over the course of this project, I got use apply 
skills learned in class as well as develop new skills.<br>
				&emsp; &emsp; I would encourage non-Honors students to pursue a capstone. The best advice I can give it to make a 
plan & schedule for getting your capstone done, then follow it.
