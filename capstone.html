				&emsp; &emsp; As the power of CPUs and GPUs increases, air cooling is becoming increasingly 
				inadequate to cool these devices. The alternative, liquid cooling, can remove much more heat 
				and will be necessary to cool future devices. Currently, Dell has liquid-cooled server racks which they 
				market and sell to customers. However, if the server racks are transported in extreme cold weather, the 
				liquid coolant inside can freeze solid, breaking electronic components.
				Dell has tasked a Texas A&M senior design team with designing a method for draining and filling 
				coolant.They have determined that removing 10% of a server’s coolant will allow it to freeze during shipping 
				without harming the system or any individual components. Currently, Dell does not drain coolant before shipping, 
				so its current system is at risk.

          <p>
				&emsp; &emsp; My capstone is my mechanical engineering senior design project. I have been 
				tasked by Dell to design a coolant draining and filling solution for its servers. Dell needs 
				to remove coolant from its servers before shipping, as the coolant can freeze during shipping 
				and break components. It then needs to top off coolant once the servers arrive at their destination.<br>

 

				&emsp; &emsp; This is my chance to tackle an actual problem from a company. As a design problem, there are many possible 
				solutions that could meet Dell’s needs. It will be a challenge to narrow down the possibilities and 
				find a suitable solution. It will also be a challenge to define what these needs are and what constitutes 
				a suitable solution. I look forward to developing these skills. Since I am interested in engineering design 
				and want a career in that field, this project fits my interests. It will help me develop my design skills, 
				better preparing me for my first job. This connects to my ability to plan. As I create my project, I want 
				to understand, improve, and achieve: understand the current problem, improve upon current solutions, and 
				achieve a solution that meets my needs.

        <h2 class="w3-text-teal w3-padding-16" style="text-align: center">So What?</h2>
        <div class="w3-container" style="line-height: 200%;">
          <p>
				&emsp; &emsp; Mechanical Engineering senior projects are projects provided by a sponsor company. In my 
				section, I was given four projects to choose from, which were from Dell, Pumps and Pipes, Baker Risk, 
				and Shell. I chose to do the project on filling and draining coolant from Dell, because it sounded the 
				most interesting. After choosing my project, I was put into a 6-person design team. While we sometimes 
				delegate tasks, we typically discuss and complete tasks as a team. Through meetings, we collaborate to 
				make design decisions.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; In the lecture portion of my senior project class, we are taught different approaches for each step of 
				the engineering design process. This includes different methods for defining needs, generating requirements, 
				brainstorming solutions, and concept selection. I am thrilled to learn strategies for creative design, since 
				this is what I want to do with my career. I am growing by improving my skills in this area. So far, I have 
				learned how to decompose a problem, generate a solution-neutral problem statement, define needs, generate 
				requirements, brainstorm solutions, and select a concept.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Currently, I am in the brainstorming and concept selection phase. I am a little disappointed that I can’t 
				design something truly innovative, but unfortunately, this does not fit with the requirements that I defined 
				with my team. The design will end up being modular, since the final product needs to be easily reproducible.

        <h2 class="w3-text-teal w3-padding-16" style="text-align: center">Now what?</h2>
        <div class="w3-container" style="line-height: 200%;">
          <p>
				&emsp; &emsp; My capstone is my Mechanical Engineering senior design project. This project has an accompanying 
				lecture, where I learn about different parts of the design process. This information has been integral in 
				completing my project. However, this is not the only learning I use. Recently, I had to perform some 
				calculations using knowledge I gained in fluid mechanics. Furthermore, many of my design choices are driven 
				by manufacturability. I learned how important this is to consider last semester, when I designed a metal scissor 
				lift that was challenging to build. This was a painful learning experience that has driven many design choices in 
				my current capstone.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; I want to pursue a career in mechanical design, so this project is teaching me steps of the design 
				process that I will hopefully use in my future career.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; As the power of CPU’s and GPU’s increases, water cooling is becoming increasingly inadequate to 
				cool these devices. Water cooling has the ability to remove much more heat, which is why dell includes liquid 
				cooling infrastructure on its server racks. My project will help Dell ship these racks more safely, paving the way 
				for more liquid cooled computers.<br>

				&emsp; &emsp; Working with a customer has been a valuable learning experience. Before this project, I never realized 
				the complexities of defining a design problem. It took several meetings for my team and I to understand what Dell was 
				truly looking for, and what they envisioned as a solution. This process has transformed my thinking towards how design 
				problems are defined.
